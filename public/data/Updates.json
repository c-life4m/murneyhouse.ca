Most of the front end functionality, like calendar date/room selection, price calculation and request submission is in place and looks functional. The back end is being built and tested as you read this. For a casual visitor here - this site is in its MVP stage and most of the text/prices are place-holders for testing and will be updated in the finished site. Meantime, feel free to poke around and shoot us a message via contact form if you find any bugs."
